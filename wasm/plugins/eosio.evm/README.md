# Contract
Configure eosio.evm/include/eosio.evm/constants.hpp as needed with constants such as token symbol.

Please note that setting the JS-SDK will not currently work if OPTRACE or PRINT_STATE are set to true as it will print more information to EOSIO console.

### EVM Notes
- Account and code tables were merged to match the specification in the Ethereum Yellow Paper
- Account States are scoped by the index of the account. The index of an account never changes, thus this is guaranteed to be unique.
- NUMBER opcode returns tapos_block_num, as that is the only EOSIO block number available to contracts
- The RLP encoding in "create" uses RLP (uint64_t eos_account, uint64_t nonce)
- No patricia merkle tree is used
- The balance value is printed in explorers, etc as a big-endian hex value with a precision of 10^18, as specified in Ethereum yellow paper. Therefore, 1 EOS is represented as 1000000000000000000, which is de0b6b3a7640000 in big-endian hex.

### Precompile support
eosio.evm supports all 9 precompiles
1. ec_recover
2. sha256
3. ripemd160
4. identity
5. expmod
6. bn_add
7. bn_mul
8. bn_pairing
9. blake2b

## Constants
All constants are found at [constants.hpp](eosio.evm/include/eosio.evm/constants.hpp)

1. **TESTING** - adds functionality for executing tests, and resetting the contract; default true, remove in production
2. **BN_CURVE** - adds bnadd, bnmul, and bnpair precompiles; default true
3. **CHARGE_SENDER_FOR_GAS** - toggle charging sender for gas; default false, required for ethereum tests
4. **PRINT_LOGS** - prints logs as part of execution receipt; default false
5. **OPTRACE** - prints the opcode trace for the execution; default false
6. **PRINT_STATE** - prints the state when saved or loaded from tables; default false
7. **TOKEN_SYMBOL_CODE_RAW** - the symbol of the core token on-chain; default "EOS"
8. **TOKEN_CONTRACT_RAW** - the contract of the core token on-chain; default "eosio.token"
9. **TOKEN_PRECISION** - the precision of the core symbol on-chain; default 4

**NOTE:** [TESTING, CHARGE_SENDER_FOR_GAS] must be enabled, and [OPTRACE, PRINT_LOGS] must be disabled for ethereum/tests testing to pass successfuly.

**NOTE:** If ec_add, ec_mul and ec_pairing precompiles are required, set BN_CURVE to true (will increase WASM size by 210KB, or ~2MB onchain).

### Contract Public Actions
```c++
ACTION raw ( const eosio::name& ram_payer,
             const std::vector<int8_t>& tx,
             const std::optional<eosio::checksum160>& sender);
```
- `ram_payer` Name of account paying for RAM costs
- `tx` will take a raw Ethereum transaction RLP hex encoded without the '0x' prefix
- `sender` is an optional parameter used when the `tx` is not signed
&nbsp;

```c++
ACTION create ( const eosio::name& account,
                const std::string& data);
```
- `account` is the EOSIO account creating the new Ethereum account
- `data` is an arbitrary string used as a salt to create the new Ethereum account
&nbsp;

```c++
ACTION withdraw ( const eosio::name& to,
                  const eosio::asset& quantity);
```
- `account` is the EOSIO account associated with an Ethereum account with a balance
- `quantity` is an EOSIO asset like "4.0000 SYS" for the amount to withdraw
&nbsp;

```c++
[[eosio::on_notify("eosio.token::transfer")]]
void transfer( const eosio::name& from,
                const eosio::name& to,
                const eosio::asset& quantity,
                const std::string& memo );
```
- Standard transfer function used to deposit balance into associated Ethereum account. If the depositor does not have an EVM account associated, the transaction will fail to execute.
&nbsp;
```c++

ACTION call( const eosio::name& ram_payer,
             const std::vector<int8_t>& tx,
             const std::optional<eosio::checksum160>& sender );
```
- Function to mock execute and view result (no state modifications are persisted), similiar to Web3 call()
&nbsp;

### Contract Tables
```c++
struct Account {
  uint64_t index;
  eosio::checksum160 address;
  eosio::name account;
  uint64_t nonce;
  std::vector<uint8_t> code;
  bigint::checksum256 balance;
}
```
- `index` - auto-incremented counter for accounts, also used as scope index for AccountStates
- `address` - Ethereum 160 bit address
- `account` - EOSIO account associated with Ethereum account
- `nonce` - Current nonce of the account
- `code` - Contract code for Ethereum account if present
- `balance` - 256 bit balance stored as a bigint (shows as big endian when printed). The precision is 10^18 as specified in Ethereum whitepaper. 1 EOS is thus represented as 1000000000000000000 which is de0b6b3a7640000 in big-endian hex.

```c++
struct AccountState {
  uint64_t index;
  eosio::checksum256 key;
  bigint::checksum256 value;
}
```
- `index` - auto-incremented counter for account states, only used as primary key
- `key` - big-endian encoded key for storage
- `value` - big-endian encoded value for storage
